MB_AdminMoney
---------------------
This module enables Check/Money order ONLY in the admin to place orders without paying them. 
This can be useful for several cases as promotions, sponsorships and gifs who needs to be in the shop record.

As an extra I added a system config to allow this feature to be controlled with a select in System - Configuration - Payment Methods - Check / Money Order -  Enabled in admin only

Remember to enable Check / Money Order to make this extension work.
